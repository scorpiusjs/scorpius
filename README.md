Scorpius is a Meteorbased Admin System built for small and large scale applications. With full ES2015 support, the system is structured from the ground up with the latest advances in Javascript technology.

Speed optimization and accuracy is at the core structure of Scorpius.

Scorpius is originally a fork of the awesome [Orionjs](https://github.com/orionjs/orion)
project.  As Scorpius evolves it aims to stay inline with the latest features of Meteor.
